# HuggingChat FastAPI

This is an API interface for HuggingChat, built using FastAPI. The project implements an OpenAI-compatible API using [hugging-chat-api](https://github.com/Soulter/hugging-chat-api).

   venv\Scripts\activate  # For Windows
   source venv/bin/activate  # For Unix or MacOS
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example` and fill it with your data.

5. Run the server:
